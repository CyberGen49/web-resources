# Web Resources
A collection of web resources for use in my other projects. These files are hosted with GitHub Pages at [src.simplecyber.org](https://src.simplecyber.org).

These resources are primarily for internal use, so documentation isn't a high priority. In the meantime, all [base.js](/base.js) functions are documented, so a little trial and error should be all that's needed to get things up and running.
